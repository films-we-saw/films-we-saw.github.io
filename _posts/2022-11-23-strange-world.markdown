excerpt: "A properly lovely kids film, decent LGBTQ+ representation, gorgeous art styles and amazing creatures. 

Also really loved the healthy masculinity on display through the film, the men all grow and evolve as the story progresses and I'm here for it.

Score: 9/10 

A properly lovely kids film, decent LGBTQ+ representation, gorgeous art styles and amazing creatures. 

Also really loved the healthy masculinity on display through the film, the men all grow and evolve as the story progresses and I'm here for it.

Would have paid for, would pay for again, will definitely rewatch.
