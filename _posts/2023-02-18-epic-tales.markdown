excerpt: "Cute animation style. Story managed to wedge in deals with the mob, hero worship and family relationship drama into 90 mins. It was a cutesy story, but not sure I'd have paid for it but would've happily streamed for free if I was hungover. There's only like one ickky bit and it progresses the story so I'll tolerate it. 

7/10, won't rewatch til Im hanging but would fully recommend"

Score: 7/10 
Cute animation style. Story managed to wedge in deals with the mob, hero worship and family relationship drama into 90 mins. It was a cutesy story, but not sure I'd have paid for it but would've happily streamed for free if I was hungover. There's only like one ickky bit and it progresses the story so I'll tolerate it. 

7/10, won't rewatch til Im hanging but would fully recommend
