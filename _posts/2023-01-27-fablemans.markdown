excerpt: "It was okay, not sure it was an interesting enough story for a whole film. Enjoyed the narrative of him loving film forever, but always makes me wonder how true it is.

Not a big enough fan to know who the director at the end giving advice was or if he followed the advice.

Wouldn't watch again or really recommend, but I didn't hate it."

Score: 6/10 

It was okay, not sure it was an interesting enough story for a whole film. Enjoyed the narrative of him loving film forever, but always makes me wonder how true it is.

Not a big enough fan to know who the director at the end giving advice was or if he followed the advice.

Wouldn't watch again or really recommend, but I didn't hate it.
