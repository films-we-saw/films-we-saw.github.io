excerpt: "This was so much better than any D&D film had the right to be. The characters were great - enjoyed their distinctly different roles in the party and the way they all ended up working together. 

I thought you wouldn't have needed to know about D&D before - things are explained if you needed it, but not at the expense of boring people who knew what an Owlbear was. Would 100% rewatch and will definitely be recommending to anyone looking for a light and silly film - it was loads of fun."

Score: 10/10 

This was so much better than any D&D film had the right to be. The characters were great - enjoyed their distinctly different roles in the party and the way they all ended up working together.

Could rave avout this film for days.
