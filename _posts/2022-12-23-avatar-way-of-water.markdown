excerpt: "The world building was good and it was pretty af, but endless military nonsense ruins that niceness. A film that's at least an hour too long about how dad's that are from a military background will mess up their kids in consistent and sad ways. 

Wouldn't rewatch, would like the three hours of my life back and would have been annoyed to pay for it."

Score: 2/10 

The world building was good and it was pretty af, but endless military nonsense ruins that niceness. A film that's at least an hour too long about how dad's that are from a military background will mess up their kids in consistent and sad ways. 

Wouldn't rewatch, would like the three hours of my life back and would have been annoyed to pay for it.
