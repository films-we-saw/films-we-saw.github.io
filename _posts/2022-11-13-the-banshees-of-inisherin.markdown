excerpt: "A lot of my score is based on the cinema classifying this as a drama and all of the trailers positioning it as two lads fall out and then maybe they'll make up. That's not what this film is about. It's escalating madness for the whole time but set against the background of the irish civil war. 

From the guy who made In Bruges and apparently if you knew what you were going to see, it was good but it had more multiation than I needed on a casual sunday evening."
