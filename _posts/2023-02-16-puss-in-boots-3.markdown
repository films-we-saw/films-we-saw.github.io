excerpt: "Better than the fourth film in a shrek spin off series has any right to be. Puss confronts his mortality and literal death, makes a friend and finds love in 90 mins - pure efficiency. 

Enjoyed so many different bits. The cave with his past lives was a real highlight. There's also like 45 seconds of dingleberry jokes. 

8/10 would watch again, not sure how I feel about recommending it though"

Score: 8/10 

Better than the fourth film in a shrek spin off series has any right to be. Puss confronts his mortality and literal death, makes a friend and finds love in 90 mins - pure efficiency. 

Enjoyed so many different bits. The cave with his past lives was a real highlight. There's also like 45 seconds of dingleberry jokes. 

8/10 would watch again, not sure how I feel about recommending it though
