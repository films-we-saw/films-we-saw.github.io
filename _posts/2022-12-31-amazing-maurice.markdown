excerpt: "A cute adaptation of a Pratchett book - with some fun easter eggs for people who've read the other discworld books. Felt a lot like a straight to TV film, which it basically is when it's from Sky Studios. 

Wouldn't say it was a laugh a minute but there were some chuckles that balanced out the exceptionally dark bits (for a kids film). I think my main word for it is cute. 

I'd really like to see more adaptations of Pratchett - I want death / rincewind specific series. 

Wouldn't pay for, wouldn't watch again attentively but wouldn't protest it being on in the background."
