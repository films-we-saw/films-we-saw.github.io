excerpt: "Nice suspenseful film, good plot and waaay less cannibalism than the trailer had suggested - all of the food looked great. Another mutilation, I hope this isn't an on going trend, I'm too squeamish for that. 

New found love for Anya Taylor-Joy. Would have paid for and would definitely rewatch."

Score: 8/10 

Nice suspenseful film, good plot and waaay less cannibalism than the trailer had suggested - all of the food looked great. Another mutilation, I hope this isn't an on going trend, I'm too squeamish for that. 

New found love for Anya Taylor-Joy. Would have paid for and would definitely rewatch.
