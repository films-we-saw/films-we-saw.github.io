excerpt: "Another sequel for another superhero movie. It didn't suck and the baddies were fun, but I spent a lot of it thinking about baseball which probably isn't a good sign.

I won't recommend it, but its fairly harmless for a rewatch in the background of doing other things."

Score: 6/10 

Another sequel for another superhero movie. It didn't suck and the baddies were fun, but I spent a lot of it thinking about baseball which probably isn't a good sign.

I won't recommend it, but its fairly harmless for a rewatch in the background of doing other things.
