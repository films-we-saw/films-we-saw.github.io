excerpt: "A familar and sad story. The songs and the outfits were good but I'm not sure how many of these films I can watch where we clearly know the end and can see the path through humble beginnings, a sudden rise to fame and the inevitable manipulation by people they thought they could trust. Is it regularly the dads or is that just a weird pattern in the last few I've seen?

Would have paid for but most likely would have watched at home instead. Would scroll and rewatch if someone was keen, but I'm not suggesting it."

Score: 5/10 

A familar and sad story. The songs and the outfits were good but I'm not sure how many of these films I can watch where we clearly know the end and can see the path through humble beginnings, a sudden rise to fame and the inevitable manipulation by people they thought they could trust. Is it regularly the dads or is that just a weird pattern in the last few I've seen?
