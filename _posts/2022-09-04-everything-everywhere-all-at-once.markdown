excerpt: "I don't have enough words for how much I enjoyed this film. The blurb and tagging on the cinema website doesn't do it justice. It was brilliant and clever and fun. I will forever want to be a rock on a desolate planet without life. 

We missed the original run of this and had heard good things, but wasn't expecting it to be so great. Very glad we saw it in the cinema, would pay for, will watch again."

Score: 10/10 

I don't have enough words for how much I enjoyed this film. The blurb and tagging on the cinema website doesn't do it justice. It was brilliant and clever and fun. I will forever want to be a rock on a desolate planet without life. 

We missed the original run of this and had heard good things, but wasn't expecting it to be so great. Very glad we saw it in the cinema, would pay for, will watch again.
