excerpt: "Not the film for me - far too many bodily fluids, so ick. Not sure I liked a single character enough to root for them, felt like they all maybe just needed a cuppa and a night in. 

The laughs were mainly shock / out of the moment so I'm not sure it's particularly rewatchable."

Score: 4/10 

Not the film for me - far too many bodily fluids, so ick. Not sure I liked a single character enough to root for them, felt like they all maybe just needed a cuppa and a night in. 

The laughs were mainly shock / out of the moment so I'm not sure it's particularly rewatchable.
