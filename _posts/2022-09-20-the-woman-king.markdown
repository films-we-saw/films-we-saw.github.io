excerpt: "Brilliant. So massively enjoyed this film, recommended it to everyone who asked (and a few people who didn't ask) for months. Would watch again any time. Hope it wins every award. 

Particularly loved how stacked the cast was - no skinny strong people here, proper strength and beauty"

Score: 10/10 

Brilliant. So massively enjoyed this film, recommended it to everyone who asked (and a few people who didn't ask) for months. Would watch again any time. Hope it wins every award. 

Particularly loved how stacked the cast was - no skinny strong people here, proper strength and beauty.
