excerpt: "Super interesting consideration of the ethics of documentaries with previous participants talking about the impact it's had on their lives. It examines the power dynamics in the industry with growing commercialisation and demand but also on an individual level between subjects and filmmakers. 

It also raises points about ongoing consent and intentional further participation.
