excerpt: "I hadn't read the book, so this was a super cute but unexpectly sad Saturday morning film. There was a tension every time he looked determined, but it was all fine. Tom Hanks was good at being grumpy. 

Enjoyed the slow reveal of the story. Would recommend, but not sure how rewatchable it is. "

Score: 8/10 

I hadn't read the book, so this was a super cute but unexpectly sad Saturday morning film. There was a tension every time he looked determined, but it was all fine. Tom Hanks was good at being grumpy. 

Enjoyed the slow reveal of the story. Would recommend, but not sure how rewatchable it is.
