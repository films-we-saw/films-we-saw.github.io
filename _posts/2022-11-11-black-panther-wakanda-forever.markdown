#Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
22nd October 2022

Score: 4/10 

It had some cute nice bits, but overall, pretty meh. I have lots of questions about the physics of the water kingdom. Like so many. 

If they could all consume the flower and get powers, couldn't the people of wakanda do that too? Or is that against tradition? Why not just tell people what was happening? So, so many questions.

Will likely watch again, but not super willingly.
